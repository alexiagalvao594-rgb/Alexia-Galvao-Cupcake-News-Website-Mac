    <h1>Newport Woman Cannot Escape Cupcakes</h1>

    <p>A woman from Newport, Rhode Island has started to encounter buttercream-frosted delicacies everywhere she looks. In her purse, under her covers, and even in her car! "I just woke up one day and started finding them everywhere" Rebecca tells a local news source. "At first it was amazing, but when I tried one, it tasted disgusting!"</p>

    <p>Scientists cannot explain this phenomenon, as they truly only seem to appear when Rebecca is around. In clinical studies, other participants have tried the cupcakes, and report that they "taste delicious", which stumps scientists even more. They advise people to go and examine their tastebuds, and are currently running tests on Rebecca to determine if there is something medically wrong with her-- because who doesn't like cupcakes!</p>
